Problem:-Given a list of integers, print each element using Streams.

Java 8 Streams provide a functional way to process collections, and printing elements uses the terminal forEach operation on a stream from the list. This approach replaces traditional loops with declarative code.

Step-by-Step Logic
Convert the list to a stream using list.stream(). Apply forEach with a Consumer that prints each integer via System.out.println. The stream consumes after the terminal operation, ensuring one-time execution.
​

Complete Implementation:-

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class PrintIntegersStream {
    public static void printUsingStream(List<Integer> numbers) {
        numbers.stream()
               .forEach(System.out::println);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        printUsingStream(numbers);
    }
}


This prints each number on a new line. Method reference System.out::println simplifies the lambda.

Thought Process
Start from the source collection and chain to stream(). Choose forEach as the simplest terminal operation for side-effect printing. Avoid intermediate ops like map since no transformation needed. Streams are lazy, so forEach triggers processing.

Edge Cases Analysis
Empty list: Stream empty, nothing prints; no exception.​
Null list: NullPointerException on stream() call; handle with null check.
Single element: Prints once without issues.
Null elements: println handles null gracefully, printing "null".
Large lists: Sequential stream fine up to millions; use parallelStream() for huge data if order irrelevant, but printing order non-deterministic.​
Consumed stream: Reuse throws IllegalStateException; create fresh each time.
