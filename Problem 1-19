Question:
Group employees by department, then count employees in each.

Input:
List of Employee objects, each with getDepartment().

Solutions:-

Java 8 Streams group employees by department then count using nested collectors: groupingBy(dept, counting()). Creates Map<String, Long> with department→count.

#Step-by-Step Logic
Stream employees → groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment, counting()).

#Complete Implementation

import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String department;
    
    public Employee(String name, String department) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
    }
    
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getDepartment() { return department; }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + "(" + department + ")";
    }
}

public class GroupByDepartmentCount {
    public static Map<String, Long> countByDepartment(List<Employee> employees) {
        return employees.stream()
                       .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                           Employee::getDepartment(),
                           Collectors.counting()
                       ));
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
            new Employee("Alice", "Engineering"),
            new Employee("Bob", "HR"),
            new Employee("Charlie", "Engineering"),
            new Employee("Diana", "Engineering"),
            new Employee("Eve", "HR")
        );
        
        Map<String, Long> deptCount = countByDepartment(employees);
        deptCount.forEach((dept, count) -> 
            System.out.println(dept + ": " + count));
    }
}

Output:
text
Engineering: 3
HR: 2

#Thought Process
Outer collector: groupingBy(dept) creates Map<String, List<Employee>>.
Inner collector: counting() converts each list to size Long.
Method reference: Employee::getDepartment clean extractor.
Single-pass O(n): One traversal builds complete map.

#Edge Cases Analysis
Empty list: Empty Map
Single employee: {dept=1L}
All same dept: {dept=n}
Null list: NPE on stream()
Null dept: null key with count
Null employees: NPE in getDepartment()
