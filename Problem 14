Question:
Skip the first three elements and print the rest.
Input:
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");

Solution:

Java 8 Streams skip first three elements using skip(3) intermediate operation, then print remaining via forEach. For input ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], prints d and e.

#Step-by-Step Logic
Stream the list via stream(). Call skip(3) to discard first 3 elements. Terminate with forEach(System.out::println) to print remaining strings.

#Complete Implementation

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class SkipFirstThree {
    public static void skipAndPrint(List<String> strings) {
        strings.stream()
               .skip(3)
               .forEach(System.out::println);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
        skipAndPrint(list);
    }
}

Prints:
d
e

#Thought Process
skip(n) discards first n elements, preserving order of remainder. Lazy operation; only executes when terminal op called. Simpler than manual indexing or sublist slicing.

#Edge Cases Analysis
List shorter than 3: Skips all available, prints nothing (e.g., [1,2] → nothing).
Exactly 3 elements: Skips all, prints nothing.
Empty list: Nothing to skip, nothing prints.
Null list: NPE on stream(); requires null-check.
Null elements: skip passes through; println prints "null".
Large skip(n): Skips min(n, size); prints remainder or nothing.
Single element: skip(3) → nothing printed.
